## TODOs
- which models should we use (go from easy to complex?):
    - KNN
    - Decision Trees
    - Logistic Regression
    - SVM
    - Neural Networks
- data Normalization
- how to fill in missing values?
    - delete rows
- when to do data split => before or after handling missing values
    - https://www.kaggle.com/discussions/questions-and-answers/471740 makes a lot of sense what they say there
    - when removing data do it before split
    - when filling in data do it after the split, as otherwise test set unintentionally influences the training process
